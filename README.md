# Vterminal
README.md

This script is a virtual operating system shell that allows users to execute various file and directory management commands. Some of the commands include:

    create <filename>: creates a new file with the specified name
    edit <filename>: allows the user to append text to the specified file
    rename <old_name> <new_name>: renames a file from old_name to new_name
    delete <filename>: deletes the specified file
    mkdir <dirname>: creates a new directory with the specified name
    rmdir <dirname>: deletes the specified directory
    ls [directory]: lists the contents of the specified directory (if no directory is specified, it will list the contents of the current directory)
    cd <directory>: changes the current working directory to the specified directory
    clear: clears the terminal screen
    color <color>: changes the text color
    bgcolor <color>: changes the background color
    reset: resets the text and background colors to their defaults
    help: displays a list of commands and their descriptions
    exit: exits the VOS shell

The script uses various Python modules such as os, sys, and struct, and also uses ANSI escape codes to change the text and background colors.
It loops indefinitely, prompting the user for input, and then executing the appropriate function based on the input.
Usage

To run the script, make sure you have Python installed and then open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run the command python script_name.py.
